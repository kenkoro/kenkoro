### A bit about me

Hey! I'm kenkoro, welcome to my GitHub page. I love FOSS and am always striving to improve my coding skills.
I'm planning to create my own content online to share my experience with others soon, like cracking challenging
topics, seeing what's under the hood of a specific technology or even maybe contributing to open source live.

### What I'm hacking on

For the most part, I prefer to stick around with Kotlin and low-level stuff, e.g. [Kotlin/Native][kotlin-native].

For a detailed overview of my contributions, please refer to the [moko-units][moko-units].
